## B-Tree Data Structure for Rocq
By: Pierre Castoran, modified and published by me.

This is the B-Tree Data Structure from the book I was reading, Coq'Art. I decided to publish it as (to my knowledge), there are no other Coq modules that represent a B-tree. This module has many supporting proofs, and I'd love to add more,
all you have to do is ask!

How to install:
```
git clone https://github.com/Tralalero-Tralalal/Coq-b-tree
cd Coq-b-tree
opam pin add coq-b-tree . --no-action
opam install . --working-dir
```
